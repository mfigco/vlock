# VLOCK Website (unfinished)
This is a mock-up of the website for an NFT marketplace that never came to fruition. Although unfinished, I invite anyone interested to check out its *sleek* design. 
Just download the project and open index.html on your preferred browser.
All artwork used is courtesy of the National Gallery of Art, Washington.
